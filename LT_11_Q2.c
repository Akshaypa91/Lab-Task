Here is a C program implementing the described functionality:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#define LARGE_ARRAY_SIZE 1024

int main() {
    char largeArray[LARGE_ARRAY_SIZE]; // Large array of size 1024
    char **p;                         // Array of character pointers
    int n;

    // Read the number of lines from the user
    printf("Enter the number of lines: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    // Allocate memory for n character pointers
    p = (char **)malloc(n * sizeof(char *));
    if (p == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    getchar(); // Clear the newline character from the input buffer

    // Read n lines of input
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("Enter line %d: ", i + 1);
        if (fgets(largeArray, LARGE_ARRAY_SIZE, stdin) != NULL) {
            // Remove trailing newline character, if present
            largeArray[strcspn(largeArray, "\n")] = '\0';

            // Allocate exact memory for the string and copy it
            p[i] = (char *)malloc(strlen(largeArray) + 1);
            if (p[i] == NULL) {
                printf("Memory allocation failed.\n");
                return 1;
            }
            strcpy(p[i], largeArray);
        }
    }

    // Find the line with the maximum length
    int maxLengthIndex = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (strlen(p[i]) > strlen(p[maxLengthIndex])) {
            maxLengthIndex = i;
        }
    }

    // Print the line with the maximum length
    printf("The longest line is: %s\n", p[maxLengthIndex]);

    // Free allocated memory
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        free(p[i]);
    }
    free(p);

    return 0;
}

Explanation:

1. Large array: A largeArray of size 1024 is used to temporarily store each line of input.


2. Dynamic array of pointers: Memory is allocated for n character pointers (p) using malloc.


3. Reading input: Each line is read into largeArray using fgets, and any trailing newline character is removed using strcspn. Memory is then dynamically allocated for the exact length of the string, and the string is copied to this allocated memory. The pointer array p is updated to point to the allocated memory.


4. Finding the longest line: The program iterates through the strings and finds the line with the maximum length using strlen.


5. Output: The program prints the longest line.


6. Free memory: The program ensures all dynamically allocated memory is freed to avoid memory leaks.



Sample Run:

Enter the number of lines: 3
Enter line 1: hello world
Enter line 2: i love clang
Enter line 3: programming

The longest line is: i love clang
